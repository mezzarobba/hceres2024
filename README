BUILDING THE REPORT

You need a recent version of TeXlive with lualatex, biber, latexmk, and many
common LaTeX packages (the most recent/least common one probably being
jobname-suffix).

- The make command with no arguments builds the full report.

- It is possible to build only a subset of the full document. For instance,

    make example/hceres2024-example.pdf

  builds the section dedicated to the "example" team. Use tab completion to
  discover the exact target names. Edit hceres2024-main.tex and the Makefile to
  define new independently buildable subsets.

  Besides the shared files found at top level and in assets/, each subreport
  should typically depend only on the contents of the corresponding directory.

- make all builds all standard subreports.
