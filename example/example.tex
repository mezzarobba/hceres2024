  For each team, the standards considered relevant to the team are
  selected from the fields. If it is neither appropriate nor necessary to
  deal with all the references, those relating to production,
  attractiveness and inclusion in society should be given priority in this
  sequence.

  In the event that all the references had to be addressed, care should be
  taken to respect the order of presentation.
